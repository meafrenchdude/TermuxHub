<p>
  <strong>Termux Hub</strong> is a lightweight, open-source Android application that indexes and organizes tools designed for use with <strong>Termux</strong>.
  It provides a clean, searchable catalog of community tools using a transparent, metadata-driven data pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  The app focuses on reproducibility and reliability. All tool information is processed automatically from a public GitHub repository,
  validated, and stored locally on your device. Once synced, the local database becomes the single source of truth,
  ensuring fast access even when offline.
</p>

<h2>Key features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Browse and search curated Termux tools by category</li>
  <li>View detailed tool information, installation commands, and repositories</li>
  <li>Daily updates of GitHub star counts and README content (00:00 UTC)</li>
  <li>Offline-first design with local Room database storage</li>
  <li>No trackers, no analytics, no ads</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
  Termux Hub fetches static metadata from GitHub and processes tool data, star counts,
  and README files independently. All validated data is stored in a local Room database.
  If syncing fails, the app safely falls back to cached or bundled data.
</p>

<h2>Data sources</h2>
<p>
  All data is <strong>read-only</strong> and sourced from the public
  <a href="https://github.com/maazm7d/TermuxHub">TermuxHub GitHub repository</a>.
  This includes tool metadata, repositories, thumbnails, GitHub stars, READMEs,
  and Hall of Fame entries.
</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>
  Termux Hub does not collect personal data, does not require accounts,
  and does not include tracking, analytics, or advertising libraries.
</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>
  Anyone can help improve the catalog. To add or update a tool,
  please see the contribution guidelines in
  <a href="https://github.com/maazm7d/TermuxHub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.
