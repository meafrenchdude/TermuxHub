## Adding a New Tool

### Step 1: Edit `metadata/metadata.json`

Add your tool entry to the metadata file.

#### Field Rules (Strict)

| Field         | Rule |
|---------------|------|
| `id`          | Unique, immutable, and used everywhere |
| `name`        | Tool name only (no emojis, versions, or extras) |
| `description` | One clear and concise sentence |
| `category`    | Must match **one** allowed category exactly |
| `install`     | Termux-compatible shell commands (`\n` allowed) |
| `thumbnail`   | Leave empty |
| `repo`        | GitHub HTTPS URL only (no trailing slash) |
| `author`      | GitHub username or organization (no URL) |
| `requireRoot` | `true` or `false` |
| `publishedAt` | Format: `DD-MM-YYYY` |

#### Allowed Categories

- OSINT & Recon  
- Web Security  
- Network Security  
- Exploitation Tools  
- Brute Force  
- Social Engineering  
- Android Security

### Step 2: Add Thumbnail (Mandatory)

Thumbnail is **required** for every tool.

**Path**
`metadata/thumbnail/<tool.id>.webp`

#### Thumbnail Rules

- Format: **WEBP only**
- Aspect Ratio: **16:9**
- Filename **must exactly match** `tool.id`
- Missing thumbnail = **PR rejected**

## Stars and READMEs (Auto-Generated)

The following files are **automatically managed**:

- `metadata/stars.json`  
  - Updated daily at **00:00 UTC**
- `metadata/readme/{tool.id}.md`  
  - Fetched directly from upstream GitHub repositories

**Do NOT edit these files in pull requests.**
